# # DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Make a hash to store a laptop's brand, model, and year. 
# Then print each attribute on separate lines.

laptop = {brand: "banana", model: "split", year: "2023"}
puts laptop[:brand]
puts laptop[:model]
puts laptop[:year]

# I got it on the first try, 
# I want to make it through the rest of the array/hash section then practice methods
