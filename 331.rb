# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# Use variables to store two numbers, 
# then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, 
# and prints -100 otherwise.

x = 1
y = 2

if x > 10 || y > 10
    puts 100
  else
    puts -100
  end
  

  # this was harder for me, I forgot about "||"
