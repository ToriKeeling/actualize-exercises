# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a program that uses variables to store two numbers, 
# then prints the numbers added together.

a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b
puts c

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# yes this was easy for me, I will tackle the next deliberate practice problem on the list
