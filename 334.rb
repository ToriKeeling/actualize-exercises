# QUESTION 1
# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. 
# After the user is done, the program will tell the user 
# which word was entered the most frequently.
# For example, if the user enters: 
#   apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear
# The program will say: "apple was your most common word"
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)

# create 10 varibles for strings with gets.chomp
# write a while loop to compare each variable to eachother

puts "Tell me 10 words and I'll tell you which word you used the most"
word1 = gets.chomp
word2 = gets.chomp
word3 = gets.chomp
word4 = gets.chomp
word5 = gets.chomp
word6 = gets.chomp
word7 = gets.chomp
word8 = gets.chomp
word9 = gets.chomp
word10 = gets.chomp


index = 0
while index < 10
    index = index + 1
if word1 = word2

end
