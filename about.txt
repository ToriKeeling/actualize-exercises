Hello! My name is Tori Keeling. I moved to Chicago 7 years ago to pursue acting but because of my choices to send support home to my family I found that acting and giging full time was not sustainable for me in, well, all of the ways. In 2019 fell into a full time position doing IT Support for CounselEAR, a local cloud based OMS system that provides service to audiology clinics. I've always felt like a fish out of water using computer technology and that feeling only grew with my new role. When I was told about Actualize by my friend Joey I was immediately inspired to join. Not only to grow my skill sets in my current field of work, and to also increase my income for the sake of my 100 year old home thatâ€™s in need of repairs, but to prove to myself that I can learn these skills that in years past I have believed were impossible for me to understand. I know I can do this, I am excited to be here.
