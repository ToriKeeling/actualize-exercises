# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Write a program that uses variables to store two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
a = "Hey"
b = " Y'all!"
puts a.upcase + b.upcase


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I struggled a bit, I tired to use .uppercase instead of .upcase. I will memorize some of these basics
