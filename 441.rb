# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# Make a hash to store definitions for 2 different words. 
# Then add a new word and definition and print the hash to see the result.

words = { cat: "meow", cow: "moo"}
words[:dog] = "ruff"
pp words

# I did not get this on thei first try, 
# I tried to write an array of hashes which is not what it asked
# plowing ahead with the deliberate practices with arrays and hashes so they can sink into my noggin jelly
