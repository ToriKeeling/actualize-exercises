# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Convert a string into a hash 
# with keys for each letter in the string 
# and values for the number of times the letter appears in the string. 
# For example, "bookkeeper" becomes {"b" => 1, "o" => 2, "k" => 2, "e" => 3, "p" => 1, "r" => 1}.
