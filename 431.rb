# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.


# Write a method that takes in a string and returns the string repeated 5 times. 
# Then run the method and print the result.

def r_string(string)
    return string * 5
end
pp r_string("MAma")

# i was not, it was the syntax that got me. I will continue deliberate practice with methods.
