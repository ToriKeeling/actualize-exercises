# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Write a program that uses a variable to store a number, then prints that number plus 1
x = 1
puts x + 10


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#I wasn't, I thought I needed a loop vs the answer above. 
#Reading comprehenshion got me along with making this more complicated than it needed to be.
